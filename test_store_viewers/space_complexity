The file test.txt, with 1000000 usernames with an average length of 22 (range: 4-40)
is the size of 24.031.232 Bytes / 240.303.14 Bytes (without file size) -> file byte size = 918 bytes
so we can assume a single user takes about
this means each user takes on an estimated:
24.031.232 / 1.000.000 = 24,031232 ~ 24 Bytes or rather 25 bytes to be more generous

Lets estimate that at each given moment there are 100 streams with 100.000 (100k) viewers each.
An lets also assume that each 10 minutes we take a snapshot of each user, saving all 100k viewers
Also assume that every streamer only streams for an hour and every hour a new streamer starts their stream with 100k
on a day this would amount to:

Amount of snaps each day:                10 minutes = 6 per hour. 24 * 6 = 144 snap shots
Amount of data per snap:                 100 streams -> 100 * 100.000 = 10.000.000 viewers
                                         1 viewer = 25 bytes, -> 250.000.000 bytes, 250MB, 0.25GB
                                         0.25GB * 144 -> 36GB (way to huge)
Amount of data per streamer (file size): 918 bytes per file, 100 streamers every hour -> 2400 per day
                                         -> 2400 * 918 -> 2.203.200 Bytes -> 2MB, 0.002GB,
                                         which is about 0,008% of the data per snap. so for every byte of data it is
                                         fair to assume the storage size is 0,01% of the data size

1 Viewer = 25 bytes + 0.25 (0,01% storage cost)

In actuality the bytes per viewer will be higher if there are more streamers observed,
but with less viewers each, amounting to the same amount of viewers.

Lets use a more realistic average
(Right now 30/08/2021 04:06 the top stream and top 100 stream are 130k and 3.5k
 -> Ø66,75k, however there are less channels at 130k than 3.5k so lets roughly adjust for that bias (just a guess)
(1 * 130k + 3 * 3.5k) / 4 -> Ø36k
so 100 streams -> 100 * 36.000 -> 3.600.000
3.600.000 * 25,25 bytes
 90.900.000 Bytes / 90MB, 0.09GB
0.09GB * 144 snap -> 12,96 GB

And lets also adjust for a more realistic streaming schedule of 1000 streamers streaming once a day
(assuming a new snap doesnt add information):
then it only amounts to the original 0,9 GB (* 10 because more streamers but less streams is realistic)
For a year this would amount to 328,5 GB (not including expected time deltas)

Switching the model from getting a snap per shot lets switch it to 24/7 observation:
